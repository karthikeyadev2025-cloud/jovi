/**
 * Onboarding email sequence — runs daily.
 *
 * Picks up users whose auth.users.created_at falls on the lookback
 * days [0, 3, 10, 14] and sends the matching email IF and ONLY IF a
 * row doesn't already exist in onboarding_emails_sent for that step.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running the same day = no duplicates (unique
 * constraint on user_id + step in the schema).
 *
 * Run from cron / pg_cron / systemd timer:
 *   npx ts-node src/jobs/onboarding-emails.ts
 *
 * Or programmatically by calling runOnboardingEmails().

Welcome to Jovio. Your 14-day free trial just started — no card required.

Three things to do in the next 5 minutes:

  1. Pick a voice profile (Standard / Clinic / Real Estate / Premium)
       → ${dashboardUrl}/setup
  2. Forward your business number to the Jovio DID we set up
  3. Make a test call to see it in action

If you get stuck, just reply to this email. I read every one.

    daysAfter: 3,

    body: ({ firstName, dashboardUrl }) => `Hi ${firstName},

Day 3 of your Jovio trial. Quick check-in — has the AI handled any
real calls yet?

  • If yes: take a peek at the call recordings + transcripts at
    ${dashboardUrl}/calls — you'll see exactly what callers heard
    and what was booked.
  • If not: most likely the forwarding isn't active. Common fixes:
    https://docs.jovio.in/call-forwarding

Any questions, just reply.

    body: ({ firstName, dashboardUrl }) => `Hi ${firstName},

Heads up — your 14-day Jovio trial ends in 4 days.

To keep your AI receptionist running without interruption, pick a plan:
  → ${dashboardUrl}/billing

Plans start at ₹1,999/month (Starter — 200 mins). The first month is
fully refundable within 7 days if Jovio doesn't fit.

If you'd rather not continue, no action needed — your account becomes
read-only and is deleted after 30 days. All your call data is exportable
from the dashboard until then.

    daysAfter: 14,
    subject:   () => "Your trial ended — what now?",
    body: ({ firstName, dashboardUrl }) => `Hi ${firstName},

Your 14-day Jovio trial ended today. Your AI receptionist has stopped
accepting calls, but your data is safe and exportable for 30 days at
${dashboardUrl}.

To pick up where you left off:
  → ${dashboardUrl}/billing

If Jovio wasn't a fit, I'd love to know why — just reply with a
sentence. It's the single most valuable feedback we get.
