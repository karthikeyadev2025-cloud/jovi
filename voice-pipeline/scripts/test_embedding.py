"""
One-time verification: confirms the Gemini embedContent REST call actually
works against the real API before the knowledge-base RAG feature is
trusted in a live call. Run this once after deploying, before relying on
retrieve_context() during real conversations.

This exists because knowledge.py was written without network access to
generativelanguage.googleapis.com to test against — the REST shape follows
Gemini's documented convention, but "documented" and "verified against the
real API with this exact key/account" are different claims. Run this,
don't skip it.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/test_embedding.py
