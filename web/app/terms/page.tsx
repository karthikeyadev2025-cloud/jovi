        Jovio is provided "as is". The AI receptionist makes its best effort but is not a

        critical-decision contexts. You are responsible for configuring appropriate
        fallback numbers for situations requiring human handling.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Jovio's total aggregate liability for any
        claim arising out of or related to the Service is limited to the amount you paid
        us in the 12 months preceding the claim. We are not liable for indirect,
        incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms limits liability for fraud, gross negligence, or any
        liability that cannot be limited under Indian law.

      <h2>11. Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Jovio from third-party claims
        arising from (a) your breach of these Terms, (b) your violation of law, or (c) your
        Data infringing a third party's rights.
      </p>
